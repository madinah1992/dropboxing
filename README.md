# Welcome to My Dropbox

## Task
The challenge is to create a user-friendly file synchronization and management application that allows users to upload, manage, and share files seamlessly. The goal is to provide an intuitive interface for users to organize their files into folders, view them online, and maintain version control, while also ensuring that files can be accessed from anywhere.

## Description
This project solves the problem of inefficient file management and sharing by providing a robust web application that allows users to upload files, create folders for organization, and view files online. By implementing features such as file versioning and expiration dates, users can maintain a clear history of their documents. The application utilizes Firebase for backend services, including file storage and database management, ensuring that files are securely stored and easily retrievable.
